# DIYRobocarEdmonton
## Description

[diyrobocars](https://diyrobocars.com/) is for people who want to make and race DIY autonomous cars of any size, from tiny 16th scale to full size, including go-karts. The overall aim of the group is to make and race pro-level autonomous cars on a budget. That means that theyâ€™re smaller than regular cars (from go-kart size, down to 1/16th scale) and can be used indoors.

## My plan

The big idea and reason for me being apart of this is that I am on a (currently) one man team, and basically starting from square one. Anybody who's interested in being apart of this project, please let me know!

I intend on competing sometime at the end of fall or the beginning of winter, but plan to start now in building up my knowledge and experience in working with robotics both for electronics and software!
